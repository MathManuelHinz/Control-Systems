A few comments:
- If you have any corrections write me a mail / message or open an issue on github 
- I would advise against using these notes closely after a lecture, I will prob. correct some small stuff on the next weekend :)
- There is a journal at the end of the notes offering a quick summary of the main points of each lecture. These are also written by me, so don#t rely on them to much!
- \makesavenoteenv{tcolorbox} might cause your compilation to fail, if your LaTeX installation is out of date! You can safely comment that line out, although the footnotes will be worse (confined to the colorboxes, instead of the pages)
